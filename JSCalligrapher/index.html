            The JavaScript Calligrapher is a tool enabling the design of
            stylized characters to be saved and drawn out on a canvas in real time.
            This tool was designed with the main goal of teaching stroke order
            to learners of a new language/writing system, but of course the utility
            extends beyond the scope of stroke order to allow a great variety
            of artistic expression.
