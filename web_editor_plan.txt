Web Editor Desired Features:
Select text, can generate new tag to wrap around
Shortcut to apply CSS properties to specific elements:
- Will pop down list of possible selectors, starting with id, then class, then more general
  + Text can be directly edited
  + Have CSS ordered by first appearance of selector in DOM tree
- Example: Command + P brings up menu to edit position property
  + Absolute positioning would trace up rendering tree to determine anchor ancestor
  + Top, left, etc. would then be calculated relative to this element
- Sizing should be easily converted among em, percent, etc.
Multiple windows for views of pure HTML, HTML with box-model, or only display view
- Displays box model with tags
  + Will need way to resolve overlap/move back one layer
